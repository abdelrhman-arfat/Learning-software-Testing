# 🧪 Software Testing Practice with TypeScript & Jest

This repository is dedicated to learning and practicing **software testing** using **TypeScript**, **Jest**, and **Puppeteer**.

## 📚 Topics Covered

- Unit Testing with Jest
- Integration Testing with Jest
- End-to-End (E2E) Testing with Puppeteer
- Testing Utility Functions
- Test Organization and Structure
- Test Match Patterns and Folder Structure
- TypeScript Configuration for Jest
- ESM Support in Jest with ts-jest
- Writing Descriptive Test Cases

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- TypeScript
- Jest
- ts-jest
- Puppeteer
- Node.js

## 🚀 Goal

The goal of this repo is to:

- Build confidence in writing different types of tests
- Improve software quality
- Explore best practices for test writing
- Automate testing before each push

## ⚙️ CI Automation

A `CI.sh` script is used to **automatically run all tests before pushing** any code to Git. This ensures:

```bash
  ./CI.sh
```

- All unit, integration, and E2E tests pass
- Code stability is maintained
- Continuous quality assurance during development
